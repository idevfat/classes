//identity-based policy that denies access to any actions outside the Regions specified using the aws:RequestedRegion condition key.
//This policy uses the NotAction element with the Deny effect, which explicitly denies access to all of the actions not listed in the statement. 
//Actions in the CloudFront, IAM, Route 53, and AWS Support services should not be denied because 
//these are popular AWS global services with a single endpoint that is physically located in the us-east-1 Region. 
//Because all requests to these services are made to the us-east-1 Region, the requests would be denied without the NotAction element.
